# Weather App 🌦️

## Welcome! 👋

Welcome to the **Weather App**, a modern and responsive web application designed to provide real-time weather information using the **Weather API** and **Firebase** as the backend database. This project is built with **React** and leverages the power of **JavaScript** to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Features ✨

- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Fetch and display current weather conditions for any location.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for weather information by city or region.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works on all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **Firebase Integration**: Utilizes Firebase as a backend database to store user preferences or historical data (if applicable).
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Background changes based on the current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy).

3. **Data Display**: The app dynamically updates the UI to display the weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
4. **Firebase Integration**: Optionally, user preferences or search history can be stored in Firebase for a personalized experience.
